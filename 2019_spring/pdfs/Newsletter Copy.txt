Pier Ye, Pier Ye

It's that wonderful time of year when nautical hearts, young and old, turn to the challenges of readying our vessels for the launch of a new boating season.


Slip Holders: Renew your 2019 contracts on Key Day. Please remember to bring your boat registration and proof of insurance. If you plan on either giving up or not using your slip this year, please call Don Price at 410.647.1189 as soon as possible.


Pier Slips: Anyone interested in adding their name to the Pier Slip Wait List, fill out the application found at www.CarrolltonManor.com and bring it to Key Day or mail it to CMIA with a check for $25.00. Please include a working phone number as we will need to call you. The wait list is updated on CMIA website annually, but kept current by Pier Committee. 


We make an effort to allow as many residents as possible to enjoy our community pier. Pier slip sublets MAY be made available again this season when possible. This is managed by the pier on a first-come/first served basis, as deemed available, and is not guaranteed.  If interested, please contact Don Price at 410.647.1189 to get on the ‘Sublet List’.


Do not store a boat on the beach! Boats left on the beach and in the woods are not only an eyesore, but a potential danger to children and pets as well as a breeding ground for insects and rodents. Unattended boats will be considered abandoned and removed.

April Showers Bring May Flowers


There may still be snow on the ground but, if you are like me, you are staring out the window and dreaming up plans for spring. CMIA has been beautifying our community properties with a focus on using native plants. HillBottom Beach has been certified as ‘Bay Wise”- a Bay Friendly property that will support the healing of the Severn, with minimizing pollution footprints practices.  This year, as you plan your summer garden and yard, consider native landscaping.


Using native plants in your yard is an excellent way to help the Chesapeake Bay. Native plants are the flowers, ferns, trees, shrubs, and grasses that have always grown, and are adapted to our area. They don’t need the amount of fertilization and insecticides as non-native plants, and require less watering and maintenance to thrive. When we replace our lawns with native trees, shrubs and perennials, we reduce the amount of chemicals and water run-off from our properties during rain events, carrying pollutants directly into storm drains and the Severn River. Native plants generally have deep root systems that can help the negative pollutants from runoff and help reduce and control erosion.  


Reducing pollutants that seep and flow into the Severn River is one way everyone can help clean up and improve the river we all enjoy. 




It is also important to eliminate, or replace, non-native and aggressive, invasive plants in your yard. Invasive plants, such as English ivy, bamboo, and kudzu, may harbor harmful pests and can easily spread out of control - overwhelming and killing native, more beneficial vegetation.


Native plants in your yard is an excellent way to increase wildlife habitat. Native plants provide the best source of food for birds, butterflies and other critters. So, plant a Butterfly, Songbird, Humming Bird, or Critter Garden this year and enjoy all the wonders of going ‘native’.


Native wildflowers, flowering vines, shrubs, and trees offer a wide range of colors, textures and forms to create dynamic seasonal displays. Grasses and sedges have interesting flowers and seed heads and yellow–orange fall color. Shrubs and trees have fall color and berries that persist into the winter. Choosing a wide assortment of plants ensures seasonal interest, with the bonus of attracting colorful birds, butterflies and insects

The best way to figure out which plants are native is to explore a book or online guide that describes native plants. Here are some excellent resources to help you get started:

Spring Reminders
* The days are finally getting warmer and everyone is starting to come out to play. You never know when a child or pet will dart out into the street. Please remember to drive carefully through our narrow streets, slowly and with care!

* As we clean up from winter, please remember, yard waste and tree trimmings should be composted or placed at the curb for weekly pickup,  Please do not dump your yard waste on CMIA Community Property. Unfortunately, this has become a big problem. We have been working hard to beautify our neighborhood. Planting is fun……but having to clean up trash is not!


   * Please never ever let your pet leave ‘poo’ on the community beaches, in the street, or on your neighbor’s yard.  Pick up and dispose of poop properly in the trash. Pet waste bacteria is one of the leading causes of unhealthy water quality for the Severn River


   * Please teach your children respect, and pride, for their community. Do not let your children pick the flowers in our community gardens, break branches off trees, or leave litter/trash on CMIA properties or at the bus stops. Community pride, and responsibility, can start early.
